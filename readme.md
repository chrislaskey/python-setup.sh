About
================================================================================

A deployment bootstrap script for setting up Python environment tasks like
installing setting up a virtualenv and importing requirements.txt into pip. Can
be run multiple times, it is written to be idempotent.

Version 1.0.4

Though somewhat flexible, this is built with
[YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it "You aren't gonna
need it") in mind and not meant to be a general purpose deployment script.
